Assingment 2. 08/09/18
======================================================

General notes:
======================================================

- This program executes all 4 parts of assignment 2
- Each part of assignment is writtem in separate file. 
- The 1st and 2nd parts of First task are wirtten if files - task1a.lisp and task1b.lisp respectively. The same with Second task.
- In the First task, where depth and branching factor are reqiured, program can generate a maximum of 18278 elements
- If there is a very large number of elemets required (~ 10000 or more), program may run a bit slow.
- Branching factor should be >= 2and depth should be >= 1
- If branching factor is < 2 or depth is < 1, error message will be output and program will end
- In the second task, if entered node does not exist in the list, program will output traversed list till the very last node, as it means that full list was traversed and target was not found
- Code was written in the Sublime Text editor. Because of that some part of the code and comments may be shifted
  and become a bit messy if opened in another editor such as vim or gedit

 2. In terminal, change the directory to assignment2
 3. Running a First part of First task:
	- In terminal type: clisp task1a
	- Program will request to enter depth and branching factor
	- Enter depth and branching factor
	- Output will be printed to the terminal

4. Running a Second part of First task:
	- In terminal type: clisp task1b
	- Program will request to enter depth and branching factor
	- Enter depth and branching factor
	- Output will be printed to the terminal

5. Running a First part of Second task:
	- In terminal type: clisp task2a
	- Program will request to enter the list to travese and target node
	- Enter the list and target node
